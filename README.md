I wanted to learn creating games with html5 using phaser.

# Running the game
Running a Phaser game directly in a browser doesn't work, that's because Javascript is not allowed to load files from your local file system. To solve that you have to use a webserver to play the game.

here are some simple ways to run a local webserver

#### From the command line

For python3:
```shell
$ python -m http.server
```
For Python2:
```shell
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
#### you can use apps like wamp (windows) or mamp (mac)

You can download WAMP (Windows) or MAMP (Mac). They both have a clean user interface with simple set up guides available.

##### Use Brackets
Open the directory containing the game in the Brackets editor and click on the small bolt icon that is in the top right corner of the window.
